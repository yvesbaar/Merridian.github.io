          <p class="content__m-contentImg__a-imgText">A wonderful Complexity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole
          heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my
          dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents.
